Types of Data :
1. Relational Data
2. Image
3. Audio

Definition:
A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer , so that it can be used efficiently

1. Mathematical / Logical models
eg: Abstract Data types : List , Read , Modify element 

List 
- store a given no 
- read elements by position
- modify elements at a position

Array - concrete implementation
Linked List - another concrete implementation

Abstract Data Types
