i am so distracted now 
i get lost 
i need to stick to one resource 

my mind has gone to gutters 
i really cant focus on the text 
how do i focus i think i need to learn things by coding rather than from videos 

i know i can watch videos i need to solve problems 
just fucking solve problems 
i need to stick to a source 
how many resources have i changed 
fuck 
do you remember anything you watched on strivers videos 
can you solve the problems the same ones if given to you
how are your basic problem solving skills
do you know how to write basic programs 
can you really solve 

i feel like i am not making any progress 
when it comes to computer science 
why is that ?
first i need to learn a language 
C++ is the language 
what about C language i was learning 
will it be used will i ever move beyond computer languages 
yes 
fuck these courses

computer languages are the language used to describe things to computer
