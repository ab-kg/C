Before understanding Linked List or any other data structure 
we need to understand the realtionship between structures and functions

1. Passing structure member as argument
2. Passing structure variable as argument
3. Passing pointers to structures as arguments
4. Returning a structure variable from the functions
5. Returning a pointer to a structure from the functions
6. Passing array of structures as argument
7. Self Referential structures
