--- ARRAY VS LINKED LIST ---

OPERATIOIN                  - ARRAY        - LINKED LIST 
 
1. Accessing an element     -  O(1)        - O(N)
2. Memory requirements      - Fixed size   - 
3. Inserting element 
    at beginning            - O(N)         - O(1)
    at end                  - O(1)         - O(N)
    at middle               - O(N)         - O(N) traversing will be there 
                              shifting                           
4. Ease of use              - easy         - difficult ( specially with c and c++)


---------------------
Accessing an element in array will have O(1) time complexity as we can find the 
address of any element by just mutiplying with 4 and adding to the address of the
first element . 

1   2   3   4   5 
200

address of 5 => 200 + 4*i 

One operation will give us the index of the element in array as all the elements
are arranged in the same order or all are adjacent in memory .
