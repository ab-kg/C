// here we are going to learn about address arithmetic of multidimensional arrays

// knowing the address of the element besides the known address element is easy you just need
// to add the size of the data type 

// 1d array 
// a = 1    2    3    4 


int a[2][2][2];

// pointer to the first 2D array
// here this array has 2 2d arrays
// here each of which contains two 1D arrays
// Each 1D array contains two elements 

// 1 2 | 3 4   || 5 6 | 7 8 
// a[1][0][0] = 5 

// a[1][1][0]
